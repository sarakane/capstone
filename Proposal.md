# Capstone Proposal

### Name of Student:Sara Kane

### Name of Project: Resourcey 2: Solo Edition (as with all things, name is a work-in-progress)

### Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?) 
With remote learning the current normal, people now more than ever are using online resources to further their learning. The goal of Resourcey is to provide a space for users to gather online resources they have found helpful for learning a topic and share those resources with others — stored in one place.
Users are able to create a resource library for a specific topic or a class (examples: History 101 or Introduction to Programming) and add resources such as documentation, tutorials, online videos, or additional courses they found helpful related to that topic or class.

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
•	User registration (database storage)
•	User login/logout (database authentication)
•	Users are able to create a resource library, add sections to that library, and add a resource to that section with full CRUD functionality
•	Registered users can view another user’s resource library
•	Registered users can add a resource to another user’s resource library
•	Registered users can edit or delete resources they’ve added 

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
•	Visual Studio Code 
•	React
•	Database (not sure on specifics, want to see how next week with NoSQL goes)

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
•	Private resource libraries
•	Resource libraries that are shared with only authorized users
•	Resource libraries can have additional admins that have full CRUD functionality for library sections and resources
•	Users can upvote resources they’ve found helpful
•	Google sign-in
•	Website is hosted

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
•	Google Sign-in
•	Web hosting (not sure on specifics)

### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
I decided I wanted to remake the last team week project I worked on. Ultimately, I would like to have a usable version of the project that I could host. I’m not sure on all of the specific technologies I will use for this project. I do know I want to use React for the frontend. Please let me know any suggestions you have for features.
